//  TODO:
//    Plots can follow a simple template, and you just substitute particular
//    nations or items as required.
//
//    Once a certain number of related clues are cracked, each pertaining to a
//    particular step, then you deduce what their overall 'goal' is.  That
//    gives you the chance to foil them early, but... actual conviction depends
//    on what percentage of clues you manage to get... meaning it may actually
//    be in your interest to allow further steps to proceed.  That way, you can
//    put them away permanently- and get further up the food chain.


//  Come up with 3-4 plot-templates for the moment.  Work with that and see
//  what happens.
