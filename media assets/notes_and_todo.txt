I want a simpler interface, just for the case itself.

I want a limitation to locations and full descriptions.  All you really care
about is the headquarters, hideout and target, plus faction, time and aim.

I want to exhaust the number of leads pretty fast.  (Per location.)
  Search.
  Wiretap.
  Surveil.
  Undercover.

Don't bother with steps (or make it a minor aspect.)





Update the map so that it looks better.

Pare down the list of facilities to what's essential.

You need to create adjacency-effects for different facilities, and allow their
effects to spill over into nearby districts.

Cut construction down to 6 months or so, and increase lead-following to 1 week.




You need to give each agent some unique flavour, based on costume.
  *  Phobos has free ultrasound and stealth/mobility.
     Bonus to surveillance/search.
  *  Deimos has rapid fire/double-tap and heavy armour.
     Bonus to busts/reports.
  *  Black Swift has sidekicks and melee mastery.
     Bonus to guarding/tipoffs.
  *  Dr. Yang has disguise and misdirection/false alarm.
     Bonus to questioning/wiretap.

Add some reluctance, initiative and motives for agents- agents should
auto-assign themselves to leads and other tasks.



You need to create some alternative henchmen for different villains and their
factions.

You need to add some intelligence to their motions/patrol patterns, and to
distribute them more evenly about the map.

Add the full tech tree and range of gadgets.



Scenes should generate procedurally in random ways using corner/mid/inside
segments.

You might add a UI for building up scenes.
