I want a simpler interface, just for the case itself.

Use the state of the plot to determine stages, instead of tense?




Update the map so that it looks better.

Pare down the list of facilities to what's essential.

You need to create adjacency-effects for different facilities, and allow their
effects to spill over into nearby districts.

Cut construction down to 6 months or so, and increase lead-following to 1 week.




You need to give each agent some unique flavour, based on costume.
  *  Phobos has free ultrasound and stealth/mobility.
     Bonus to surveillance/search.
  *  Deimos has rapid fire/double-tap and heavy armour.
     Bonus to busts/reports.
  *  Black Swift has sidekicks and melee mastery.
     Bonus to guarding/tipoffs.
  *  Dr. Yang has disguise and misdirection/false alarm.
     Bonus to questioning/wiretap.

Add some reluctance, initiative and motives for agents- agents should
auto-assign themselves to leads and other tasks.



You need to create some alternative henchmen for different villains and their
factions.

You need to add some intelligence to their motions/patrol patterns, and to
distribute them more evenly about the map.

Add the full tech tree and range of gadgets.



Scenes should generate procedurally in random ways using corner/mid/inside
segments.

You might add a UI for building up scenes.
