Notes:

*  Goons should patrol, ideally.  And hostages need to show correct behaviour.

*  The same villain should not appear in two places at once!

*  Scenes need to have a bit more in the way of cover.

*  Reform the dodge/parry system so that it's not directly connected to AP.
   
*  There needs to be more of a sense of 'getting' something out of a mission:
     Evidence and contraband.
     Rewards for information or property returned (PR bonus if refused.)
     Captive supervillains for containment, intel or rehab.
     
     *  Clues to track down supervillains and their plots (after a heist.)
     *  The chance to liberate scientists, engineers or a hero.
     *  Foiling an invasion, with the chance to recover relics or materials.

*  Plots and clue-research.  3-4 adaptable templates for the moment.  Okay.

*  Research & development.  6-8 key technologies for the moment.


*  A wider range of abilities for the current heroes.  3-4 each, say.

*  XP gain and skill-advancement over time.  (Either pick skills out of a hat
   or have an explicit training mechanic.)

*  The basics of role-play elements- gaining guilt, gaining luck, the effects
   of killing, support and pledges.
