Notes:

*  I need to turn the pressure on during a given mission.  Either goons need to
   be a credible threat, or escape needs to happen, or there should be hostages.
   
   I'm not sure the flat percentile-subtraction method is ideal.  There should
   always be *some* chance of hitting or missing.  Or maybe dodge/block ONLY
   happens if you explicitly script it?
   
   Goons should patrol, ideally...


*  A wider range of abilities for the current heroes.

*  XP gain and skill-advancement over time.  (Either pick skills out of a hat
   or have an explicit training mechanic.)

*  The basics of role-play elements- gaining guilt, gaining luck, the effects
   of killing, support and pledges.

*  Research & development.
