Notes:

*  A wider range of abilities for the current heroes.

*  XP gain and skill-advancement over time.  (Either pick skills out of a hat
   or have an explicit training mechanic.)

*  The basics of role-play elements- gaining guilt, gaining luck, the effects
   of killing, support and pledges.

*  Research & development.

*  Hostages and captives.  Plus extra goon-types!
