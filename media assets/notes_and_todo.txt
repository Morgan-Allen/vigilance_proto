* What is the advantage of solving plots anyway?
  
  It's the only way you can have troops there (including police) in time
  to catch the perps.  Otherwise the crime just goes ahead and fucks up
  the joint.
  
  (You will also have the opportunity to raid their hideout instead,
  which prevents the crime from happening entirely, though there's less
  evidence for involvement.)
  
  So while there's an ongoing case, idle agents will present themselves
  for assignment.  And you'll receive a report on what the results turn
  out to be.
  
  Once you narrow down a distinct location, you'll have a chance to go
  on a strike mission.
  
  If there are no ongoing cases, your agents will have the opportunity
  to train, socialise, engage with petty crime, rest & recover or
  research new techs and policy initiatives.
  
  Yeah.  That will work.
  

*  More intelligent objectives for goons on a map.
*  Motion in 3 dimensions?  Hmm.  Long term plan- multiple floors should
   do the trick at least.

*  Simplified XP system and more distinctive abilities for heroes (but
   training still matters a great deal.)

*  A Tactical Map where you can review crimes levels and open cases.
*  Steadily escalating threat-levels due to top-level factions (OSIRIS,
   Phalanx or the Mons.)
*  More fully-featured plot generation, and streamlined clue-detection
   with a range of current cases for display.

*  A Day Office where you can review policy & research initiatives and 
   invest in city development projects.
