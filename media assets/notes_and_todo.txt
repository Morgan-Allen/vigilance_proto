Update the map so that it looks better.

Pare down the list of facilities to what's essential.

You need to create adjacency-effects for different facilities, and allow their
effects to spill over into nearby districts.

Cut construction down to 6 months or so, and increase lead-following to 1 week.




You need to give each agent some unique flavour, based on costume.
  *  Phobos has free ultrasound and stealth/mobility.
  *  Deimos has rapid fire/double-tap and heavy armour.
  *  Black Swift has sidekicks and melee mastery.
  *  Dr. Yang has disguise and misdirection/false alarm.

Add some reluctance, initiative and motives for agents- agents should
auto-assign themselves to leads and other tasks.



You need to create some alternative henchmen for different villains and their
factions.

You need to add some intelligence to their motions/patrol patterns, and to
distribute them more evenly about the map.

Add the full tech tree and range of gadgets.



Scenes should generate procedurally in random ways using corner/mid/inside
segments.

You might add a UI for building up scenes.
