You need to create adjacency-effects for different facilities, and allow their
effects to spill over into nearby districts.

Cut construction down to 6 months or so, and increase lead-following to 1 week.



I want a simpler interface for the cases themselves.

Use the state of the plot to determine stages, instead of tense?




You need to give each agent some unique flavour, based on costume.
  *  Phobos has free ultrasound and stealth/mobility.
     Bonus to surveillance/search.
  *  Deimos has rapid fire/double-tap and heavy armour.
     Bonus to busts/reports.
  *  Black Swift has sidekicks and melee mastery.
     Bonus to guarding/tipoffs.
  *  Dr. Yang has disguise and misdirection/false alarm.
     Bonus to questioning/wiretap.

Add some reluctance, initiative and motives for agents- agents should
auto-assign themselves to leads and other tasks.



You need to create some alternative henchmen for different villains and their
factions.

You need to add some intelligence to their motions/patrol patterns, and to
distribute them more evenly about the map.

Add the full tech tree and range of gadgets.



Scenes should generate procedurally in random ways using corner/mid/inside
segments.

You might add a UI for building up scenes.
