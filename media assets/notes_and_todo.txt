Update the map so that it looks better.

Either agents need to auto-assign themselves to leads and other tasks, or leads
need to be more persistent.



Pare down the list of facilities to what's necessary.

You need to create adjacency-effects for different facilities, and allow their
effects to spill over into nearby districts.

Cut construction down to 6 months or so.
Increase lead-following to 1 week.




You need to give each agent some unique flavour, based on costume.
  *  Phobos has free ultrasound and mobility.
  *  Deimos has rapid fire/double-tap and heavy armour.
  *  Black Swift has sidekicks and melee mastery.
  *  Dr. Yang has disguise and misdirection/false alarm.

Add some reluctance, initiative and motives for agents.



You need to create some alternative henchmen for different villains and their
factions.

You need to add some intelligence to their motions/patrol patterns, and to
distribute them more evenly about the map.

Add the full tech tree and range of gadgets.



Scenes should generate procedurally in random ways using corner/mid/inside
segments.

You might add a UI for building up scenes.
