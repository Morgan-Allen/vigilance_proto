SCENES & ACTIONS:
  Motion options.  {Sneak, Move, Dash}
  Damage options.  {Disarm, Hit, Kill}
  Defend options.  {Evade, Guard, Sentry}

  Stealth increases effective sight-range from enemies by a random increment
  each turn (average 1 tile for every 10 points.)

HERO STATS:
  Heroes have 4 base stats, which is all that's shown by default.  Brain, Will,
  Reflex, and Muscle.
  Health & Stress.  Luck & Experience.
  Plus Armour, Regen & default Min/Max Damage.
  Everything else (and there's quite a bit of it) is derived.  (You can get
  info via tooltips or maybe an optional 'detail' view.)

NATION STATS:
  Freedom.  Equality.  Education.  Environment.
  Wealth.  Crime.
  Trust.  Tech & Infrastructure.  Enforcement.



Notes:

*  Goons should patrol, ideally.  And hostages need to show correct behaviour.

*  The same villain should not appear in two places at once!

*  Scenes need to have a bit more in the way of cover.

*  Reform the dodge/parry system so that it's not directly connected to AP.
   
*  There needs to be more of a sense of 'getting' something out of a mission:
     Evidence and contraband.
     Rewards for information or property returned (PR bonus if refused.)
     Captive supervillains for containment, intel or rehab.
     
     *  Clues to track down supervillains and their plots (after a heist.)
     *  The chance to liberate scientists, engineers or a hero.
     *  Foiling an invasion, with the chance to recover relics or materials.

*  Plots and clue-research.  3-4 adaptable templates for the moment.  Okay.

*  Research & development.  6-8 key technologies for the moment.


*  A wider range of abilities for the current heroes.  3-4 each, say.

*  XP gain and skill-advancement over time.  (Either pick skills out of a hat
   or have an explicit training mechanic.)

*  The basics of role-play elements- gaining guilt, gaining luck, the effects
   of killing, support and pledges.
