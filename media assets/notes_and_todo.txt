You need to add some intelligence to goons' motions/patrol patterns.

You need to give each agent some unique flavour, based on costume.
  *  Phobos has free ultrasound and stealth/mobility.
     Bonus to surveillance/search.
  *  Deimos has rapid fire/double-tap and heavy armour.
     Bonus to busts/reports.
  *  Black Swift has sidekicks and melee mastery.
     Bonus to guarding/tipoffs.
  *  Dr. Yang has disguise and misdirection/false alarm.
     Bonus to questioning/wiretap.
Scenes should generate procedurally in random ways using corner/mid/inside
segments.

Prefer hideouts in industrial/slum/disused areas, or if owned by the plot's
faction.  And add medium-descriptions to roles, to determine if specific leads
can tune in or not.




Add the full tech tree and range of gadgets.

You need to create some alternative henchmen for different villains and their
factions.

Add some reluctance, initiative and motives for agents- agents should
auto-assign themselves to leads and other tasks.

    

Pare down the list of facilities to what's essential.
  Player (possibly as upgrades to existing districts):

    Prison

You need to create adjacency-effects for different facilities, and allow their
effects to spill over into nearby districts.

Cut construction down to 6 months or so, and increase lead-following to 1 week.


I want a simpler interface for the cases themselves.

Use the state of the plot to determine stages, instead of tense?



You might add a UI for building up scenes.
