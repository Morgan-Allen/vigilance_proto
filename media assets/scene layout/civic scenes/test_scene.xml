  Refer to the object at a given space by it's index.  Use n(orth), e(ast),
  s(outh) and w(est) to rotate an object by 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees.
  
  Note:  For objects more than 1 tile wide or high, you only need to mark the
  top-left corner of the object BEFORE rotation.  Other spaces the object might
  fill can be blank.
  
  Use these characters to add walls/doors/windows to a particular space:
  Wall Left:    [
  Wall Bottom:  _
  Wall Right:   ]
  Wall Top:     ‾
  Window:       . (also represents blank tiles, filled by the floor)
  Door:         /
  
  Example:
    [‾ ‾  ‾  ‾]
    [  1  .   ].
    [  .  2e  ]/
    [_ _  _  _]
  
    This will create a walled-in 4x4 area with an object of type 1 toward the
    top-left corner, one of type 2 toward the bottom-right rotated by 90
    degrees, and a door and window on the right wall.
