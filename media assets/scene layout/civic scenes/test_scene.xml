  The various prop (object) definitions are pretty self-explanatory, but a
  couple of notes:
  
  Allowable subtypes are:
    SUBTYPE_WALLING and SUBTYPE_FURNISH
    (Walls are usually for partitions/exteriors, furniture for interiors.)
  
  Allowable blockLevels are:
    BLOCK_NONE, BLOCK_PARTIAL and BLOCK_FULL
    (How easily a character can move through the object.)
  
  Allowable blockSights are:
    true and false
    (Whether this blocks a character's vision.)

  A scene is defined by it's name, ID, width, height (which are required) and
  object-types for the floor, wall, door and windows.
  
  Note:  walls, doors, windows and even the floor-type are optional (though you
  might get a crash if you try to add walls without a wall-type?)
  
  Fixed scenes define a grid, including a map between index-numbers and object-
  types for furniture.  The grid then specifies contents for each x/y point
  within it's width and height.  (Each point should be separated by whitespace,
  but the amount doesn't matter.)
  
  
  Refer to an object in a given space by it's index.  Use n(orth), e(ast),
  s(outh) and w(est) to rotate an object by 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees.
  
  If you want to leave a space blank, just leave a period (.)
  
  Note:  For objects more than 1 tile wide or high, you only need to mark the
  top-left corner of the object before rotation.  Other spaces the object might
  fill can be blank.
  
  Example 1:
    .  .  .
    .  2s 1
    .  .  .
    
    This will create a 3x3 area with an object of type 1 on the right and an
    object of type 2, rotated 180 degrees, in the middle.
  
  
  Use these characters to add walls/doors/windows to a particular space:
  Wall Left:    [
  Wall Bottom:  _
  Wall Right:   ]
  Wall Top:     ‾
  Window:       '
  Door:         /
  
  Example 2:
    [‾ ‾  ‾  ‾]
    [  1  .   ]'
    [  .  2e  ]/
    [_ _  _  _]
  
    This will create a walled-in 4x4 area with an object of type 1 toward the
    top-left corner, one of type 2 toward the bottom-right rotated by 90
    degrees, and a door and window on the right wall.
